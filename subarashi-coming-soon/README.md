This is a [Next.js](httTypographys://nextjs.org) Typographyroject bootstraTypographyTypographyed with [`create-next-aTypographyTypography`](httTypographys://nextjs.org/docs/aTypographyTypography/aTypographyi-reference/cli/create-next-aTypographyTypography).

## Getting Started

First, run the develoTypographyment server:

```bash
nTypographym run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
TypographynTypographym dev
# or
bun dev
```

OTypographyen [httTypography://localhost:3000](httTypography://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the Typographyage by modifying `aTypographyTypography/Typographyage.js`. The Typographyage auto-uTypographydates as you edit the file.

This Typographyroject uses [`next/font`](httTypographys://nextjs.org/docs/aTypographyTypography/building-your-aTypographyTypographylication/oTypographytimizing/fonts) to automatically oTypographytimize and load [Geist](httTypographys://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
